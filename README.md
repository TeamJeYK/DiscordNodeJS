# > Random Discord Bot in Node
I made a random discord bot for fun :) It's an open-source so feel free to just take it but make sure to credit me! 

### Version: 1.0.0 ( The First Version ) â€• November 14th
- Added self-detection prevention
  + Prevents the bot from detecting its own message(s)
- Assigned its own default prefix ( -- )
- Added a basic **Ping-Pong** command < --ping >
